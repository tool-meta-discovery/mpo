""" this module is intended to represent the full backend 
pipeline with all steps needed for the discovery process. 
This includes the representation of all supported event
filters, trace filters, discovery algorithms and quality
measures. It also contains a set of capsule objects which 
provide important functionalities towards the frontend 
of this project and the main optimization phase. 
 
If you want to find out more about the different sets of 
supported processing techniques, check out the enumerations
in the  corresponding submodule to get an overview. If you want 
to know more about the specific implementation of any of the 
included techniques, take a look at the submodule with the name
'Supported'. """
